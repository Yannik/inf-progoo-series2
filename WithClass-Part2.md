With Class
===================

 - `class`: a class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. it defines various fields and methods. (in my class hierachy, "Car" is a class.)
 - `object`: an object is an instance of a class. (in my class hierachy, "new Car" creates a new "Car" object.)
 - `superclass`: parent class of a class. the class which is subclass of the superclass inherits all fields and methods from the superclass. (in my class hierachy, "EnginePowered" is the direct superclass of "Car". "Vehicle" is a superclass of "Car" too, as it is a superclass of "EnginePowered".)
 - `subclass`: child-class of a parent. inherits all fields and methods of the parent. (in our example, " (in my class hierachy, "Car" is a subclass of "EnginePowered", but also of "Vehicle"., as "EnginePowered" is a subclass of "Vehicle".)
 - `inheritance`: the child class can use the methods and fields of the parent class. (in my class hierachy, "Car" has all the same methods and fields of "Vehicle" and "EnginePowered")
 - `variable`: variables are of a certain type, name and value. the type can be an object-type or primitive type. in OOP, they also have a specific visibility if they are defined in the class scope. (in my class hierachy, the "Car" class has a field(=variable) "velocity" of type double with a visibility of private.)
 - `operator`: an operator is part of an expression. an expression may return a mathematical result (Example: "5 * 5") or an comparison result (boolean, example: "(5 < 3)" returns false).
